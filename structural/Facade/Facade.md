# Why

The Facade design pattern is used to provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It helps in:

- Reducing complexity by hiding the intricate details of the subsystem.
- Improving code readability and usability.
- Decoupling the client code from the subsystem, making the system easier to maintain and extend.
- Promoting loose coupling between subsystems.

By using the Facade pattern, you can make your code more modular and easier to work with.
